# Flow-Fields
By: _Skylar Phanenhour_

Base ideas from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7cUOPYducc
***
This project uses JavaScript and it's canvas elements to draw graphics on a page.  
The flow-field is created by drawing lines and manipulating how they move around the page using math logic. This base principle can be altered to 
recognize text and images using the .getImageData method, which gets the rgba (red, green, blue, alpha) values from the canvas and searching for any
alpha values that are >1 (anything aside from the black background).
***
Code has been optimized to work in a much simpler manor and some math logic has been tweaked to personalize the flow field.  
In addition to this, the following features have also been added. 
  - Added the ability for flow field to work on images and their rgb values 
  - Made the flow field seperate for both text and images
  - Added multiple toggle modes that can be used from keybinds
  - Added the ability to display the base image/text that the flow field is active on
  - Dynamic window resizing, allows the window to be resized any amount and the flow field will not be affected
  - Pages should also work on other devices (i.e. mobile)
